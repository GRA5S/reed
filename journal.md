### day one - june 22
#### 2 hours total

after an all nighter

i want to make a delta 3d printer

im going to use parker's [DoNotDelta](https://github.com/ProgrammerTurtle/DoNotDelta) as inspiration along with some other random delta printers that i find somehwere idfk

i made this (the first image)

### day one part two - june 22
#### 4 hours total
i have no clue wtf im doingggg

ok so i made these funky corners and then these ball joints on the linear rails

the rest of the printer is the hard part though

i also want to joint the entire thing together so i can like drag it around and play with it lmfao so i figured out how a ball joint works in fusion ig

### day two - june 24th
#### 13 hours total
I made the printhead :P

i used a tz v6 2.0 hotend and a couple 5015 blower fans
its prolly gonna be bowden instead of direct drive cuz i could not find the space to put an extruder there & it lightens the weight anyway
